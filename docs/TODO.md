# Hoshi Android Roadmap

> Status values: `todo`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`.
> After every implemented feature, update this file before committing so development can resume from the current state.

## Execution Rules

- iOS is the only source of truth for user-visible UI and interaction behavior.
- If Android behavior differs from iOS, inspect the iOS implementation first and remove the difference instead of adding isolated compatibility patches.
- Use `testdata/test.epub` for EPUB reader validation and `testdata/JMdict_english.zip` for Yomitan dictionary validation.
- Each implemented feature must be verified in an Android emulator before commit.
- Each implemented feature commit must include the matching status update in this file.
- If a feature is blocked, mark it as `blocked`, record the blocker, and continue with the next feasible item.

## Roadmap

1. `in_progress` - Stabilize EPUB reading main flow
   - Save and restore reader position using the iOS `bookmark.json` shape.
   - Preserve iOS WebView paging semantics: page scroll first, chapter transition only at boundaries.
   - Keep reverse chapter transitions landing at the previous chapter end.

2. `todo` - Bookshelf and book metadata
   - Move from a single `current.epub` directory to multi-book storage.
   - Persist title, cover, folder, last access, and reading progress.
   - Align bookshelf layout, sorting, deletion, and open behavior with iOS.

3. `todo` - Reader settings
   - Implement iOS-aligned theme, font, font size, line spacing, and margin controls.
   - Apply settings through WebView CSS/JS without changing reader interaction logic.

4. `todo` - WebView selection bridge
   - Implement JS-side text selection, selected text extraction, range data, and popup anchor rectangles.
   - Keep native Android as the receiver of JS results instead of reimplementing DOM logic.

5. `todo` - Dictionary lookup popup
   - Connect lookup to `third_party/hoshidicts-kotlin-bridge`.
   - Trigger lookup from WebView selection results.
   - Align popup presentation, dismissal, and layering with iOS.

6. `todo` - Dictionary import and management
   - Import `testdata/JMdict_english.zip` through the GPLv3 `hoshidicts` bridge.
   - Implement dictionary list, enable/disable, delete, and import state.
   - Do not reimplement Yomitan import or dictionary media handling outside the bridge.

7. `todo` - Highlights and notes foundation
   - Store highlight anchors based on WebView range data.
   - Restore highlights after chapter load through JS.
   - Align highlight tap, delete, and color behavior with iOS.

8. `todo` - Anki integration
   - Investigate AnkiDroid APIs before implementation.
   - Build the smallest card creation flow from dictionary lookup results.
   - Do not copy iOS AnkiMobile x-callback behavior directly.

9. `todo` - Audio and pronunciation
   - Play dictionary audio with AndroidX Media3/ExoPlayer.
   - Read dictionary media through the existing dictionary bridge.
   - Align playback triggers and UI with iOS.

10. `todo` - Sync
    - Investigate Android Google Drive/OAuth integration.
    - Sync sidecar JSON, progress, settings, and dictionary configuration.
    - Do not reuse iOS token or keychain assumptions.

11. `todo` - Regression coverage and release hardening
    - Add EPUB fixtures for cover, images, vertical text, horizontal text, complex spine, and broken resources.
    - Expand WebView pagination regression checks.
    - Keep Gradle `test`, `assembleDebug`, and `lint` passing before release-facing changes.
